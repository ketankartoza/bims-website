The overall purpose of the platform is to support data-driven freshwater decision-making and management in South Africa.</p> <p>The system currently accepts and serves data on species occurrence, abundance and associated habitat and abiotic parameters, for anurans, fish, invertebrates, algae, odonate adults and wetland plants. It also accepts and serves water temperature time series data and physico-chemical data.</p> <p>System design and functionality was strongly informed by data and reporting needs of key end-user groups, including water resource managers, biodiversity and conservation managers and planners, scientific researchers, and environmental consultants. Future expansion of FBIS aims to increase the diversity of data accessed, data flow, geographic coverage and strategically embed FBIS into South Africa\u2019s main freshwater decision-making pipelines.</p> <p>Platform development was funded by the JRS Biodiversity Foundation through two grants: 2017-2020 (Phase 1) and 2021-2024 (Phase 2). The platform was developed by the Freshwater Research Centre in partnership with Kartoza and the South African National Biodiversity Institute.</p> <p>A scientific article has been published in the African Journal of Aquatic Science and is available here.

The Center is hosted at University of Rwanda and works in three areas: research and monitoring, bioprospecting, and conservation education and awareness raising.</p> <p>The Center plays a catalytic and coordinating role to ensure sharing of scientific knowledge and expertise for evidence-based decisions in conservation, natural resource management and climate resiliency.  We provide leadership, best practices, research, support and training in the domain of biodiversity, natural resource management, and impacts of climate change on ecosystems and livelihoods.  The goal is to encourage, enable and support stakeholders to generate and apply knowledge on biodiversity and natural resources for sustainable development. We address the need for data for national reporting requirements (CBD, NDC, etc.) and to inform existing indicators of global biodiversity trends, such as the Living Planet Index from WWF, the Red List Index, GEO BON Species Protection Index, and the need for data in land use planning decisions, restoration projects, and ecosystem health and services provisioning.</p> <p>A biodiversity information system takes biodiversity observation records that are stored in a variety of sources and formats and puts them into a standardized format on a viewing platform to enable stakeholders to access and use the information. Biodiversity data for Rwanda have been scattered and difficult to access, but are critical to understanding patterns of biodiversity distribution, ecosystem functioning, and early detection of environmental change. Species records can provide indication of climate change impacts, pollution effects, and guide development, land use planning, tourism opportunities, and monitoring of restoration efforts. An information system puts data at your fingertips for national reporting requirement needs like the CBD and NDC.   The system effectively links research to conservation and policy.</p> <p>With funding from the JRS Biodiversity Foundation https://jrsbiodiversity.org/ we are developing the first national biodiversity information system for Rwanda.  We call it the Rwanda Biodiversity Information System or RBIS. Thanks to generous collaboration from data holders who graciously shared their data sets, including independent researchers, NGOs and government institutions, we have already mobilized more than 30,000 biodiversity data records.</p> <p>We begin the RBIS with a focus on biodiversity data in freshwater ecosystems. We have mobilized data on odonates, anurans, and birds, thanks to the generous data sharing by data holders.  Our aim is to demonstrate the power of the RBIS to inform wetlands and catchment management using biodiversity data to indicate ecosystem health.  We will eventually scale the RBIS up to include all ecosystems in Rwanda.</p> <p>When you enter the Explore button, you will see the base map of Rwanda and you can begin to explore and query the system for information.

Data are best divided into four broad categories, namely:</p> <ul> <li>Biodiversity data (e.g. wetland birds, wetland plants, fish, invertebrates, algae etc.)</li> <li>Abiotic data (e.g. hydrological data, physico-chemical data, wetland condition data, etc.)</li> <li>Spatial data (used for filters and / or spatial layers; e.g. Rivers and dams, Provinces, Freshwater Ecoregions of the World, Water Management Areas, etc.)</li> <li>Third Party data (existing hydrological or water quality data sites, GBIF, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>For each category, the FBIS team needs to specify the following:</p> <ul> <li>Component (specify component)</li> <li>Details (provide details of data set, e.g. number of records, type of records etc)</li> <li>Accessibility (who has the data, is it freely available, is a MOU required?)</li> <li>Data priority ranking (ranking based on user workshop to evaluate the relative importance of different data sets, where 1 = high priority, 2 = medium and 3 = low; these rankings can also be linked to FBIS versions)</li> <li>Spatial scale (specify if the data are regional or national)</li> <li>Progress (record progress on obtaining data and inclusion in FBIS)</li> </ul> <p>A DataSet Tracker template has been generated for FBIS (FBIS DataSet Tracker Template.xlsx).

For other groups, the taxonomic level (family, genus, species etc) varies considerably from study to study, and thus it is recommended that the lowest taxonomic level is used and that Taxon is used in preference to Species (e.g. invertebrates, algae).</p> <p>The purpose of the Master List is threefold:</p> <ol> <li>To provide a comprehensive and up to date list of species/taxa for a specific group in a specific region.  This needs to be done during the initial development of an information system such as FBIS, but once the system is up and running, then the further updating of the Taxonomic backbone is done using GBIF and user-defined taxonomic uploads.</li> <li>To facilitate downloading of data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility\u2019s (GBIF), thereby ensuring that the correct taxa are included on the information system.</li> <li>To provide the taxonomic hierarchy for taxa not yet on GBIF.</li> </ol> <p>The generation of a Master List requires consultation with available resources, relevant publications and experts. A Master List is intended to be an updatable resource, improved and added to as new data and studies are published, or new taxa are described. If no species lists are available for a country then the GBIF Taxonomic Master List may be generated by extracting data from GBIF. This Master List should then ideally be checked and validated for accuracy by the FBIS team.</p> <p>The format of the Master List is important to ensure consistency for ingestion of data into the information system. The following columns are included in the Master Lists, provided as excel file template that will be used for each FBIS group (Master List Template final for FBIS Generic 2022_08_01.xlsx).

A Master List is intended to be an updatable resource, improved and added to as new data and studies are published, or new taxa are described.

The taxonomy from GBIF should be used when the taxon is on GBIF. The FBIS team can check if the taxon is on GBIF using the following link: https://www.gbif.org/species/1 and insert the relevant species, genus, family etc. in the \u201cSelect a species\u201d box.</p> <p></p> <p>Taxa that are not on GBIF may be included in a Master List but the Source (Details of the publication source for this taxon) needs to be provided.

FADA is the taxonomic backbone for its Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal. One is able to consult and download FADA data, although it is not always up to date.</p> <p>Important notes and common errors:</p> <p>It is important that the correct Taxon Rank is always used to ensure correct uploading of the data files. Taxon Rank is case sensitive so Species will upload but species will fail. Always ensure the correct Taxon Rank is applied by using the dropdown list. There should be no spaces in SubClass, SubOrder, SubFamily, SubSpecies.</p> <p>The column On GBIF: If the taxon is on GBIF, this must be Yes, then it is not necessary to add the GBIF URL. However, it is recommended that the GBIF URL be added to ensure the correct taxon is added. However, if the taxon is not on GBIF, then this must be No. Always include the full taxonomic hierarchy for all taxa (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, etc.).</p> <p>Note: It is recommended that significant time and resources are used to generate and refine the master list for each group (birds, fish, invertebrates etc) as much as possible before proceeding with data collation.

Origin and endemism: Filter records based on origin: native or non-native, where non-native includes both alien and extralimital taxa. Filter records based on endemism, where taxa are divided into eight categories as follows: - Micro-endemic level 2 (Endemic to a single river or wetland) - Micro-endemic level 1 (Endemic to less than 5 rivers or wetlands) - Regional endemic level 2 (Endemic to a single primary catchment) - Regional endemic level 1 (Endemic to a single Freshwater Ecoregion (e.g. CFE), more than one primary catchment) - National endemic (Endemic to South Africa, occurs in more than one Freshwater Ecoregion within SA) - Subregional endemic (Endemic to southern Africa) - Widespread (Occurs beyond southern Africa) - Unknow (Endemism is unknown) Conservation status: Derived from the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, a user may filter records based on global conservation status.
