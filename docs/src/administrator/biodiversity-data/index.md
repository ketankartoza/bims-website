# Administration of biodiversity data

This section provides a guide for biodiversity data administrators to mobilize and ingest biodiversity data. The steps outlined are sequential and each provides details on the process and key considerations.

> Only registered users with super user status, typically the site administrators, are able to view the administration sections and undertake the following steps related to the mobilization and ingestion of biodiversity data.

The sections covered include:

* **[FBIS Data Management Guidelines:](data-management.md)** These documents serves as a guideline for the management of freshwater biodiversity data in the Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS).
* **[Preparing and checking a Master List of Taxa before uploading:](master-list-preparation.md)** This section highlights issues and specific checks to improve accuracy of the Master List.
* **[Uploading a new Taxon Group (Module) and adding a Master List:](taxon-group-uploading.md)** This document explains the steps that super users can follow to upload a new taxon group and an associated master list.
* **[Harvesting GBIF Data:](harvesting-gbif-data.md)** This section outlines the steps for harvesting GBIF data.
* **[Managing taxa in Taxon Management:](taxa-management.md)** This documentation describes a specific administration module has been developed to allow administrators to manage taxa within the information system.
* **[Preparing and checking an Occurrence Data File before uploading:](occurrence-data-preparation.md)** This page serves as a guideline for preparing an occurrence data file for upload.
* **[Uploading Occurrence Data:](occurrence-data-uploading.md)** This section describes the steps required for uploading occurrence data.
* **[Managing Source references:](managing-source-references.md)** This document pertains to a module that allows administrators to manage metadata and citations associated with each biological occurrence record.
* **[Adding a site and biodiversity data:](site-biodiversity-data.md)** This section explains how an administrator or user adds a site and data to a site.
* **[Adding physico-chemical data:](physico-chemical-data.md)** This section explains how an administrator, or user, adds physico-chemical data to a site or prepares an excel template for bulk uploading of physico-chemical data for multiple sites and or sampling dates.
* **[Managing BIMS Admin tables:](manage-admin-tables.md)** This document is a list of actions related to the Site Administration including the BIMS table management that an administrator (super user status) may need to edit or check.
* **[Validating records (occurrence data) and new taxa:](validate-records.md)** This section explains the process when a user adds data to RBIS, and how the administrator views, checks and validates the occurrence record or new taxon.
